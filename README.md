# zsh-carthage

A small [zsh](http://www.zsh.org) plugin providing a few aliases, a re-bundled
copy of the official zsh completion file, and not much else, for usage with
[Carthage](http://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). This repository mainly exists
to keep my `.zshrc` file and directory tidy. All the hard work was done by the
Carthage team!

## Installation

Using [zplug](https://zplug.sh):

```
zplug "cfdrake/zsh-carthage"
```

## Aliases

Check `zsh-carthage.plugin.zsh` for details.

## Completions

The completion file is a copy of the one provided when installing Carthage.

It was last updated with Carthage 0.17.2.

## License

See the `LICENSE` file for details.
